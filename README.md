1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

  To write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I follow best practices like using clear naming conventions, modular design, and documentation. The CRUD Python module from Project One allowed for separation of concerns, making it easier to update the dashboard widgets in Project Two without altering the database logic. This module can be reused for future projects requiring database interactions, such as automating data entry or generating reports.

2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

  As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks and then iteratively developing solutions. For Grazioso Salvare, I started by understanding their data and requirements, which differed from previous assignments that were more theory-based. In the future, I would use techniques like data modeling and user-centered design to create databases that are tailored to client needs.

3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

  Computer scientists solve problems using computational methods, which is vital because it drives innovation and efficiency. My work on the project for Grazioso Salvare could help them analyze data more effectively, leading to better decision-making and enhanced services for their clients or stakeholders.
